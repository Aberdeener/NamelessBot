# NamelessBot
NamelessMC Discord bot

## How do I contribute to the bot?
There are a few ways of contributing to the bot for non developers and for developers. Here are two:
1. For non developers: You can head over to [NamelessMC/BotConfiguration](https://github.com/NamelessMC/BotConfiguration) and read the README.md for information on how to contribute there.
  - In that repository, you can add parameters to the `>support` command which is really helpful when it comes to providing support on common problems on the Discord.
2. For developers: You can close this repository to your computer and help make the bot better!
  - Note to developers: Please do not add useless commands to the bot that don't even have a reason (or useless commands with a reason.)
  - Be sure to keep the formatting style used elsewhere for example:
Don't do the following:
```
public boolean thisReturnsTrue()
{
    return true;
}```
We want to see the following format:
```
public boolean thisReturnsTrue() {
    return true;
}```
